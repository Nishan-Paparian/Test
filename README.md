Welcome to the /Insert Title/ TUMOLabs mini-project.

If you've participated in a mini-project before feel free to scroll down.

And if it's you're first, read on to find out more.


TUMOLabs mini-projects are open-ended self-guided projects. Each one is different and you're free to take your mini-project in any direction as long as it adheres to a few set criteria. 

You can find this criteria included in the ReadMe of each mini-project's repository. If you don't know git, don't worry. We've explained how to use everything for the project's purposes along the way.

Once you've reviewed the criteria for the project, head to the "Milestones" under the "Issues" tab. 

These Milestones are your guide. Start with the first, and work your way up. Each includes the description of what needs to be done. 

If you ever find yourself stuck or unclear, just turn to one of your peers. We're here to help each other.

You're all set. Take a look at the Criteria below, then head to the Milestones and get started with the first one, "Mini-Project Proposal".
